Not all holes, or games, are created equal.
-- George Will

This is a modpack for the game Minetest as run by the Athens team. 
We emphasize stability, reliability, and speed. We want a fun 
experience but we want a playable game. 

INSTALLATION

Modpacks are less powerful than they may appear; they cannot be enabled 
nor disabled with a single line in worlds.mt and each individual mod must 
be enabled if it is installed in the locations suggested by:
    http://dev.minetest.net/Installing_Mods

However, mods installed into: 
    worlds/<SOMEWORLD>/worldmods/
... are all enabled for that world.
